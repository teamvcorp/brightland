# Email Fix for Property Owner Requests

## Problem Identified
When property owners submitted maintenance requests, the emails were being sent but appeared empty.

## Root Cause
The `ContactEmailManager.jsx` email template was using `next/image` component instead of the proper React Email component. Next.js Image components don't work in email contexts because they rely on Next.js server-side rendering.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Email Template (`app/email/ContactEmailManager.jsx`)
**Before:**
```jsx
import { Html, Head, Body, Container, Section, Heading, Text } from "@react-email/components";
import Image from 'next/image'; // ❌ Wrong - Next.js component

<Image 
  src={problemImageUrl} 
  alt="Problem reported by tenant" 
  width={400}
  height={300}
  style={{ ... }}
/>
```

**After:**
```jsx
import { Html, Head, Body, Container, Section, Heading, Text, Img } from "@react-email/components";
// ✅ Correct - React Email component

<Img 
  src={problemImageUrl} 
  alt="Problem reported" 
  width="400"
  style={{ ... }}
/>
```

### 2. Enhanced API Route (`app/api/resend/manager/route.js`)
- Added `userType` parameter extraction
- Added detailed logging to track email data
- Updated email subject to differentiate between tenant and property owner requests:
  - **Property Owner:** "Property Owner Maintenance Request - [address]"
  - **Tenant:** "Tenant Maintenance Request - [address]"
- Added data logging before email rendering for debugging

## Why This Fixes the Issue

1. **React Email Components**: The `@react-email/components` library's `Img` component is designed specifically for email rendering and generates proper HTML img tags
2. **Next.js Image**: Next.js Image component requires server-side processing and generates special markup that doesn't work in emails
3. **Email Clients**: Email clients need simple HTML - the Img component from React Email provides exactly that

## Testing Recommendations

1. Submit a maintenance request as a property owner
2. Check the email received
3. Verify all fields are populated:
   - Name
   - Email
   - Phone
   - Address
   - Project Description
   - Message
   - Problem Image (if uploaded)
4. Confirm the email subject line shows "Property Owner Maintenance Request - [property address]"

## Additional Improvements

- Better logging to track when emails are sent
- Clearer email subject lines to differentiate request sources
- Updated email footer to say "Brightland Properties Maintenance System"

## Files Modified
1. `/app/email/ContactEmailManager.jsx` - Fixed image component
2. `/app/email/StatusUpdateEmail.jsx` - Fixed image component (preventive fix)
3. `/app/api/resend/manager/route.js` - Added userType handling and improved logging

## Additional Notes
- Also fixed `StatusUpdateEmail.jsx` which had the same issue to prevent future problems
- Both email templates now use proper React Email components instead of Next.js components
