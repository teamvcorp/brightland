## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
# NextAuth (fixes JWT error)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="l8KuvV0psYGTKJj2d+CPGFBhbOC8pxHC9OP9FpO6Ido="

# Cron job secret for automated cleanup
CRON_SECRET="Br!ghtL@nd_Cr0n_2025_K9#xM2pQ5&vL8wN3"
```

### Automated Cleanup Setup

**Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)**

Create `vercel.json` in project root:

```json
{
  "crons": [{
    "path": "/api/admin/manager-requests/cleanup",
    "schedule": "0 2 * * *"
  }]
}
```

**Option 2: External Cron Service**

Use cron-job.org or similar:
- URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/admin/manager-requests/cleanup`
- Method: POST
- Schedule: Daily at 2 AM
- Header: `Authorization: Bearer Br!ghtL@nd_Cr0n_2025_K9#xM2pQ5&vL8wN3`

  conversationLog: [
    {
      sender: 'admin',
      senderName: 'John Doe',
      senderEmail: 'admin@example.com',
      message: 'We will fix this tomorrow',

      isInternal: false
    }
