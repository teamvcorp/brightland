# Phase 3: Admin Lease Management - COMPLETE âœ…

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive lease management and payment setup tracking in the admin rental application modal. Admin can now manage lease details, view payment setup status, and enable auto-pay for approved applications.

## Files Modified

### 1. **app/admin/page.tsx**
Enhanced the `RentalApplicationModal` component with:

**New State Variables:**
- `monthlyRent` - Monthly rent amount (auto-filled from property)
- `leaseStartDate` - Lease start date picker
- `leaseEndDate` - Lease end date picker
- `firstPaymentAmount` - Calculated first payment (prorated if needed)
- `isProrated` - Flag indicating if first payment is prorated
- `enablingAutoPay` - Loading state for auto-pay enablement

**New Functions:**
- Auto-calculates prorated rent when lease starts mid-month
- `handleEnableAutoPay()` - Validates requirements and creates Stripe subscription
- Updated `handleUpdate()` to save lease information

**New UI Sections:**

1. **Lease Management Section** (Approved Applications Only)
   - Monthly rent input (auto-filled from property.rent)
   - Lease start date picker
   - Lease end date picker
   - Prorated payment calculation with visual indicator
   - Shows first payment amount when prorated

2. **Payment Setup Status Section** (Approved Applications Only)
   - âœ… Checking Account status with Stripe link
   - âœ… Credit Card status with Stripe link
   - âœ… Security Deposit status with receipt link
   - Auto-Pay status indicator
   - "Enable Auto-Pay" button with validation
   - Links to view payment methods and subscription in Stripe Dashboard

**TypeScript Interface Updates:**
```typescript
interface RentalApplication {
  // Lease information
  monthlyRent?: number;
  leaseStartDate?: string;
  leaseEndDate?: string;
  propertyId?: string;
  firstPaymentAmount?: number;
  firstPaymentDue?: string;
  isProrated?: boolean;
  // Payment setup status
  hasCheckingAccount?: boolean;
  hasCreditCard?: boolean;
  securityDepositPaid?: boolean;
  securityDepositAmount?: number;
  securityDepositIntentId?: string;
  achPaymentMethodId?: string;
  cardPaymentMethodId?: string;
  // Auto-pay and subscription
  autoPayEnabled?: boolean;
  stripeSubscriptionId?: string;
  lastPaymentDate?: string;
  nextPaymentDate?: string;
  rentPaymentStatus?: 'current' | 'late' | 'paid_ahead';
}
```

### 2. **app/api/rental-application/route.ts**
Enhanced the PATCH endpoint to accept and save:
- `adminNotes` - Internal admin notes
- `monthlyRent` - Monthly rent amount
- `leaseStartDate` - Lease start date
- `leaseEndDate` - Lease end date
- `firstPaymentAmount` - First payment amount (may be prorated)
- `isProrated` - Boolean flag for prorated first payment

### 3. **app/api/admin/enable-auto-pay/route.ts** (NEW FILE)
Complete API endpoint for enabling auto-pay and creating Stripe subscriptions.

**Authentication:**
- Requires admin session (checks `session.user.role === 'admin'`)
- Returns 401 if not authenticated or not admin

**Validation Checks:**
- âœ… All required fields present (applicationId, monthlyRent, lease dates)
- âœ… Rental application exists
- âœ… Tenant has added checking account
- âœ… Tenant has added credit card
- âœ… Security deposit has been paid
- âœ… Auto-pay not already enabled
- âœ… User has Stripe customer ID and ACH payment method

**Stripe Subscription Creation:**
1. Creates Stripe Product for the property rent
2. Creates Stripe Price for the monthly rent amount
3. Creates Stripe Subscription with:
   - Customer: User's Stripe customer ID
   - Payment Method: ACH payment method (checking account)
   - Billing Cycle Anchor: Calculated based on lease start date
   - Proration: Disabled (handled separately)
   - Collection Method: Automatic
   - Metadata: Application ID, property info, lease dates

**Billing Logic:**
- If lease starts on 1st: First payment immediate
- If lease starts mid-month (prorated): First full payment on 1st of next month
- Converts dates to Unix timestamp for Stripe API

**Database Updates:**
```typescript
{
  autoPayEnabled: true,
  stripeSubscriptionId: subscription.id,
  nextPaymentDate: calculated,
  rentPaymentStatus: 'current',
  monthlyRent,
  leaseStartDate,
  leaseEndDate,
  firstPaymentAmount,
  isProrated
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "subscriptionId": "sub_xxxxx",
  "message": "Auto-pay enabled successfully",
  "nextPaymentDate": "2024-02-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### 4. **app/dashboard/page.tsx**
Updated TypeScript interface to include payment setup status fields:
```typescript
interface RentalApplication {
  hasCheckingAccount?: boolean;
  hasCreditCard?: boolean;
  securityDepositPaid?: boolean;
}
```

## User Flow

### Admin Workflow for Approved Applications:

1. **Review Application**
   - Admin opens rental application modal
   - Reviews applicant information

2. **Approve Application**
   - Change status to "Approved"
   - Click "Update Application"

3. **Wait for Tenant Payment Setup**
   - Tenant receives approval
   - Tenant navigates to payment setup page
   - Tenant adds checking account â†’ Security deposit auto-charges
   - Tenant adds credit card

4. **Set Lease Details**
   - Admin opens approved application again
   - "Lease Management" section now visible
   - Set monthly rent (auto-filled from property)
   - Select lease start date
   - Select lease end date
   - System auto-calculates prorated payment if mid-month

5. **Review Payment Setup Status**
   - Check âœ… indicators for checking account, credit card, deposit
   - View payment methods in Stripe Dashboard (via links)
   - Verify all requirements met

6. **Enable Auto-Pay**
   - Click "Enable Auto-Pay" button
   - System validates all requirements
   - Creates Stripe subscription
   - Sets up recurring monthly rent collection
   - Shows subscription link for Stripe Dashboard

## Validation Rules

The "Enable Auto-Pay" button is disabled until:
- âœ… Tenant has added checking account (`hasCheckingAccount === true`)
- âœ… Tenant has added credit card (`hasCreditCard === true`)
- âœ… Security deposit has been paid (`securityDepositPaid === true`)
- âœ… Lease start date is set
- âœ… Lease end date is set
- âœ… Monthly rent is greater than 0

## Prorated Rent Calculation

**Example 1: Lease starts on January 15th**
- Monthly rent: $1,200
- Days in January: 31
- Days remaining (15th - 31st): 17 days
- Prorated amount: ($1,200 / 31) Ã— 17 = $656.13
- First full rent: February 1st ($1,200)

**Example 2: Lease starts on February 1st**
- Monthly rent: $1,200
- No proration needed
- First payment: February 1st ($1,200)

The system automatically:
- Calculates days remaining in month
- Computes prorated amount
- Sets billing cycle anchor to 1st of next full month
- Displays warning indicator when prorated

## UI Features

### Visual Indicators:
- âœ… Green checkmark for completed steps
- â­• Gray circle X for incomplete steps
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow info box for prorated payments
- ðŸ”µ Blue box for auto-pay status

### Stripe Dashboard Links:
- Payment Methods (checking & card)
- Security Deposit Receipt
- Subscription Details

### Responsive Design:
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Stacked inputs on small screens
- Sticky header and footer
- Scrollable content area

## Error Handling

### Frontend Validation:
- Alerts if checking account not added
- Alerts if credit card not added
- Alerts if security deposit not paid
- Alerts if lease dates not set
- Alerts if rent not set

### Backend Validation:
- 401: Unauthorized (not admin)
- 400: Missing required fields
- 400: Payment setup incomplete
- 404: Application or user not found
- 500: Server error with descriptive message

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Admin can view lease management section for approved apps
- [ ] Monthly rent auto-fills from property data
- [ ] Prorated calculation works for mid-month start dates
- [ ] Payment setup status shows correct indicators
- [ ] Stripe links work and open correct resources
- [ ] Enable Auto-Pay button validates all requirements
- [ ] Subscription created successfully in Stripe
- [ ] Billing cycle anchor set correctly
- [ ] Database updates with all lease information
- [ ] Error messages display for validation failures

## Next Steps

**Phase 4 Enhancement (Future):**
- Webhook handling for failed payments
- Automatic late fee assessment
- Payment retry logic
- Email notifications for payment failures

**Phase 5: Payment History Dashboard**
- Admin view of all payments across properties
- Filter by tenant, property, status, date
- Manual one-time charge capability
- Payment receipts and history

## Notes

- Stripe subscription uses ACH (checking account) for monthly rent
- Credit card is kept on file for fees and one-time charges
- First payment date calculated based on proration
- Subscription continues until manually canceled
- Property status can be updated to "rented" (TODO in enable-auto-pay endpoint)

---

**Status:** âœ… Complete and ready for testing
**Dependencies:** Requires Phase 1 (data models) and Phase 2 (tenant payment setup) to be complete
**Blocks:** None - Phase 4 and 5 can be built incrementally
