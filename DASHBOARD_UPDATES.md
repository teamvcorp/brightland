# Dashboard Updates - Rental Applications

## Summary
Updated the tenant dashboard (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`) to display rental applications. The admin dashboard already has full rental application management capabilities, so no changes were needed there.

## Changes Made

### Tenant Dashboard (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`)

#### 1. Added RentalApplication Interface
```typescript
interface RentalApplication {
  _id: string;
  listingName: string;
  listingType: string;
  userEmail: string;
  userName: string;
  userPhone: string;
  employment: string;
  employer: string;
  monthlyIncome: string;
  moveInDate: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'denied';
  paymentStatus: 'pending' | 'paid' | 'failed';
  applicationFee: number;
  createdAt: string;
  adminNotes?: string;
}
```

#### 2. Added State Management
- `const [rentalApplications, setRentalApplications] = useState<RentalApplication[]>([]);`
- Fetches applications on component mount using user's email

#### 3. Added Fetch Function
```typescript
const fetchRentalApplications = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/rental-application?userEmail=${session?.user?.email}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    if (response.ok) {
      setRentalApplications(data || []);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch rental applications:', error);
  }
};
```

#### 4. Added UI Section "My Rental Applications"
Displays after "User Information" section and before "Current 40% Payment" section.

**Features:**
- Shows all rental applications submitted by the logged-in user
- Empty state message when no applications exist
- Each application card displays:
  - Property name and type
  - Status badge (color-coded: yellow=pending, green=approved, red=denied)
  - Submission date
  - Move-in date
  - Payment status (color-coded)
  - Application fee amount

**Conditional Status Messages:**
- **Pending:** Blue info box with "üîÑ Application under review"
- **Approved:** 
  - Green success box with "üéâ Congratulations! Your application has been approved!"
  - Shows admin notes if provided
  - Two scaffolded buttons (disabled, "Coming Soon" badges):
    - "Complete Identity Verification"
    - "Link Bank Account for Auto-Pay"
- **Denied:** 
  - Red error box with "‚ùå Application denied"
  - Shows admin notes/reason if provided

## Admin Dashboard (No Changes Needed)

The admin dashboard (`app/admin/page.tsx`) **already has full rental application management**:

### Existing Features:
1. **Rental Applications Table** - Displays all applications with:
   - Applicant name and contact info
   - Property name and type
   - Employment details
   - Payment status (paid/pending/failed)
   - Application status (pending/approved/denied)
   - Review button for each application

2. **Application Status Filters**
   - All applications
   - Pending
   - Approved
   - Denied

3. **Application Modal** (`RentalApplicationModal` component)
   - Full application details view
   - Approve/Deny buttons
   - Admin notes textarea
   - Updates application status via API

4. **API Integration**
   - Fetches from `/api/rental-application`
   - Updates via PATCH request with status and adminNotes

## Functionality Preserved

### Existing Features Still Working:
1. ‚úÖ Rental application form (`/rental-application`)
2. ‚úÖ $25 application fee payment via Stripe
3. ‚úÖ Application submission to database
4. ‚úÖ Admin review and approval/denial workflow
5. ‚úÖ All maintenance request features
6. ‚úÖ Property management features
7. ‚úÖ Payment processing and identity verification

### Separation of Concerns:
- **Work Requests (Maintenance):** Managed through existing maintenance request system
  - Property owners submit via `/submit-request`
  - Tenants submit via `/managers` page
  - Admin manages via "Maintenance Requests" section
  
- **Rental Applications:** Now properly displayed in both dashboards
  - Tenants view their applications in tenant dashboard
  - Admins review/approve in admin dashboard
  - Separate tables, separate workflows, no conflicts

## Testing Checklist

### Tenant Dashboard
- [ ] Navigate to `/dashboard` while logged in as tenant
- [ ] Verify "My Rental Applications" section appears
- [ ] Check empty state if no applications
- [ ] Submit a rental application and verify it appears
- [ ] Check status badge colors (pending=yellow, approved=green, denied=red)
- [ ] Verify approved applications show scaffolded buttons (disabled)
- [ ] Verify denied applications show admin notes/reason

### Admin Dashboard
- [ ] Navigate to `/admin` while logged in as admin
- [ ] Verify "Rental Applications" section shows all applications
- [ ] Click "Review" button to open application modal
- [ ] Test approve/deny functionality
- [ ] Add admin notes and save
- [ ] Verify status filters work (all/pending/approved/denied)

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Submit application as tenant ‚Üí Verify appears in both dashboards
- [ ] Approve as admin ‚Üí Verify tenant sees updated status
- [ ] Deny with notes as admin ‚Üí Verify tenant sees reason
- [ ] Verify maintenance requests still work independently

## Next Steps (Scaffolded for Future)

1. **Identity Verification Flow**
   - Implement Stripe Identity verification
   - Enable "Complete Identity Verification" button on approved applications
   - Store verification status in database

2. **Bank Account Linking**
   - Implement Stripe Connect or ACH Direct Debit
   - Enable "Link Bank Account for Auto-Pay" button
   - Set up automatic rent payments

3. **Email Notifications**
   - Send email when application status changes
   - Notify admins of new applications
   - Remind tenants of pending actions

4. **Document Upload**
   - Allow tenants to upload ID, pay stubs, etc.
   - Display documents in admin review modal
