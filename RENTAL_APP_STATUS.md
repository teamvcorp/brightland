## 📋 Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Update Tenant Dashboard (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Why:** Tenants need to see their application status immediately after applying

**Tasks:**
1. Fetch user's applications on dashboard load
2. Display applications with status badges
3. Show conditional messages based on status:
   - Pending: "Under review"
   - Approved: "Congratulations!" + scaffolded next steps
   - Denied: Reason + link to browse other properties
4. Add scaffolded buttons (disabled):
   - "Complete Identity Verification"
   - "Link Bank Account for Auto-Pay"

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx`

### Phase 2: Add Admin Application Management (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Why:** Admins need to approve/deny applications

**Tasks:**
1. Add "Rental Applications" tab to admin dashboard
2. Fetch and display all applications
3. Add approve/deny buttons
4. Add admin notes field
5. Update application status via API
6. Show payment status

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/admin/page.tsx`

**Files to Create:**
- `app/api/admin/rental-applications/[id]/route.ts`

### Phase 3: Enhance Features (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Why:** Nice-to-have improvements

**Tasks:**
1. Email notifications on status change
2. Application history tracking
3. Multi-application support UI
4. Export applications to CSV
5. Application analytics
